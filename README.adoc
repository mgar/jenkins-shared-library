== Purpose

This repository is an example of a Jenkins link:{uri-jenkins-shared-library-docs}[Jenkins Pipeline Shared Library] that uses the link:{uri-shared-library-plugin}[_Shared Library Gradle Plugin_] for development and testing of shared libraries.

Explore this project by:

* Importing into IntelliJ
* Activating the `resources/idea.gdsl` to see how the Jenkins steps auto-completion works
* Build, test, and run integration tests with `./gradlew build`
* See how test code is generated for simplifying tests (like `com.mkobit.jenkins.pipelines.codegen.LocalLibraryRetriever`)
